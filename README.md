# Gestures Detection CNN Model Creation And Fine Tuning
 
The following are a list of notebooks and stuff that I had created while building the CNN model for my [SoC project](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Gestures-For-3D-Space)

## Models Based on VGG16 Conv Base

* [Hyperparameter Tuning The Models With A **VGG16** Base](https://github.com)
  
  Will update the link shortly :P
  
  * [Creating The Preliminary Model](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Gestures-CNN-Model-Creation-And-FineTuning/blob/master/VGG%20Models/Deep_Neural_Networks_For_Gesture_Recognition.ipynb)

    *Validation Accuracy* : **0.9680**

  * [Analysing the Model On The Test Set](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Gestures-CNN-Model-Creation-And-FineTuning/blob/master/VGG%20Models/Analysing%20Models%20on%20the%20Test%20Set.ipynb)

    *F1 Score* : **0.9344**

  * [Fine Tuning The Model](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Gestures-CNN-Model-Creation-And-FineTuning/blob/master/VGG%20Models/FineTunedModel_VGG16.ipynb)

    *Validation Accuracy* : **0.9808**

    *F1 Score* : **0.9959**
    
***Note*** : I haven't yet shared, the gestures datasets that I have created, so you may not be able to reproduce the results shown over here. The **Black and White Dataset** looks something like this :
